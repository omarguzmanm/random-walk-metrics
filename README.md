In this activity, we explored various stochastic movement models through simulation, trajectory analysis, and statistical comparison. It involves implementing and comparing Brownian Motion (BM), Correlated Random Walks (CRW), and Lévy Walks (LW) - three fundamental movement models with different mathematical properties.

The activities range from calculating basic trajectory properties, such as path length, to conducting advanced statistical analyses. These analyses include Mean Squared Displacement (MSD), turning-angle distributions, and step-length distributions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the movement models.
